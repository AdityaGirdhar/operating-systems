# Assignment-0: Setting up Artix VM and assembly programming

**Question 1**
> The first assignment requires you to setup your testbench VM. The VM should not require too much resources – approximately 4 GB RAM, with 2 virtual CPU cores and about 20 GB of hard drive space.
>
> You need to install Artix-base on that following the instructions on the site.
> The installation must be done using the text mode instructions (and not by using the GUI).
>
> Thereafter, you would require downloading the stock linux kernel and compiling and installing it on your testbench. Ensure that it boots up!

**Question 2**
> Write a program in x86-64 assembly (in 64-bit mode) that:
>   1. Takes a number and a string as input from the user’s console
>   2. Prints the same number and same string to the user’s console
