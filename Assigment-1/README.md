# Assignment-1: Setting up Artix VM and assembly programming

> The first assignment requires you to setup your testbench VM. The VM should not require too much resources â€“ approximately 4 GB RAM, with 2 virtual CPU cores and about 20 GB of hard drive space.
>
> You need to install Artix-base on that following the instructions on the site.
> The installation must be done using the text mode instructions (and not by using the GUI).
